If you want to show the name from the player in the nametag, you just need to write @s, it will automatically replace it with the players name.

With this Addon you can change the nametag from a Player, with the new `/nametag` command. All what you need to do is to write `/nametag set <player> "<new-nametag>"`.

`@s` in the Nametag it will automatically replace with the players name or the type ID from the entity and with `\\n` you can create a new line.


Examples:
- `/nametag set @p "my new nametag"`
- `/nametag set @a[tag=moderator] "§8[§9Moderator§8] @s"`
- `/nametag set @n[type=cat] "meow :3"`
